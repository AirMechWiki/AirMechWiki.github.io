<h3>What is this website for?</h3>
This is a website intended to list out many important and cool factors within AirMech and to just make it look cool. Something like the current AirMech Fandom Wiki we know of, but with the gimmick of the website being able to be used to full extent. 
<br>I don't know how to make the website fit mobile devices, so for the time being, cooperate with what you have.

<h3>Website is still work in progress.</h3>
Most things available are not functional.

<h2>AirMech FAQ and other notes:</h2>
<hr style="max-width: 300px; margin-left: 0;">
<h3>Where can I give feedback and discuss AirMech?</h3>
AirMech now has a Discord server. <a id="a-select" href="https://discord.gg/AirMech" style="color: orange; text-decoration: none;" id="highlight-link">https://discord.gg/AirMech</a> The AirMech community gathers here to share their experiences in real time. 
Carbon Developers are looking for your feedback and bug reports to help shape this Reboot. <br>
<br>
Never post private information on Discord. If you need help with your account, please email <a style="color: rgb(255, 194, 50);">support@carbongames.com</a> with as much detail as possible. We cannot discuss or properly track issues for individual users on the Discord server.<br>
<br>
<h3>How do I choose my AirMech and Units?</h3>
Follow the path in Town to find the buildings of interest. You should see your units at the top-left and a pad to the right of it for your AirMech.
<br> <br>
You can bring a total of 32 units with you in battle, with 8 of them active at once. While in a match, you can right-click or use the D-pad to swap individual units in the column. Press 'Tab' to cycle rows.
<br> <br>
Click the top of the AirMech panel to change classes and skins. Right-click on a part slot to automatically choose the best parts you own. Drag and drop to remove an item from any part or cosmetic slots.
